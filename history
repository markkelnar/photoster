Removed falken-storage/iPhotos/ locally cause I'm done with it.
Soon, remove that from s3.

Sync down media folder
aws s3 sync s3://falken-storage/media/ ~/pics/falken-storage/media/
Didn't sync all of it cause over 100G of it was good enough locally
I'll run photoster to see how it organizes it, then get the rest.

# Process iphotos to drive
docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v /Users/mark.kelnar/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/:/pics.in -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/:/pics.out photoster ./run.py
# Sync drive to s3
aws s3 sync /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/ s3://storage.kelnar/pics/

Add rsync to cache/ cause mac Photo Library was no longer accessible within the docker image.
rsync -av ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/ cache/
Did some research, but decided to sync files out first.
