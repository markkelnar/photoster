# See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces for how to allow mounted drive as read/write.

# Example run docker run -ti --rm -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v ~/pics/in/:/p.in -v ~/pics/out:/p.out photoster ./run.py

# Run bash into docker and run stuff
docker run -ti --rm -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/marks-laptop/pictures/:/p.in -v ~/pics/out:/p.out photoster 

# To initiate the run script
docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v /some/directory/:/p.in -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pictures/:/p.out photoster ./run.py

# Run with 
#  docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v ~/pics/in:/pics.in -v ~/pics/out:/pics.out photoster ./run.py

# The -v are volumes (directories) that are mounted within the docker image as a volume
# /pics.in and /pics.out are paths that the run.py app are looking for.  Those are how the names are 
# mounted within the Docker image.  Use those.
# The other names are directory names external to the Docker image.

# For output to the Seagate mounted drive
# docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v ~/pics/in:/pics.in -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/:/pics.out photoster ./run.py

# AWS cli tool
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html

## AWS cli
# Pulling from S3 using AWS cli
aws s3 sync s3://falken-storage/iPhoto/2014/ falken-storage/iPhoto/2014/ --dryrun

# Pushing to S3 using AWS cli
aws s3 sync /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/ s3://storage.kelnar/pics/ --dryrun


# Can't write to mounted drive?
It's mounted as read-only on my mac
https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/item/ntfs-driver-for-mac-os-master-dl/


## To clean up what I have in aws.  do this once.
# Pull down images from from S3 to ~/pics/
# Run photoster to Seagate volume
# Sync from seagate volume to s3://storage.kelnar/pics/

## Regular behavior
# plug in phone and sync photos

# Run photoster on iphotos dir to external drive of what was sync'd from phone
# dir where photos get loaded in Photos app '~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/'
cd ~/develop/photoster ; docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v /Users/mark.kelnar/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary/Masters/:/pics.in -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/:/pics.out photoster ./run.py

# or, have an application that reacts to photos added to photos and automatically runs docker processor on it to seagate volume.

# Sync from seagate volume to s3://storage.kelnar/pics
aws s3 sync /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/ s3://storage.kelnar/pics/ --dryrun
aws s3 sync /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/ s3://storage.kelnar/pics/
