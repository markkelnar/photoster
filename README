# See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces for how to allow mounted drive as read/write.

# Example run docker run -ti --rm -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v ~/pics/in/:/p.in -v ~/pics/out:/p.out photoster ./run.py

# Run bash into docker and run stuff
docker run -ti --rm -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/marks-laptop/pictures/:/p.in -v ~/pics/out:/p.out photoster 

# To initiate the run script
docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v /some/directory/:/p.in -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pictures/:/p.out photoster ./run.py

# Run with 
#  docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v ~/pics/in:/pics.in -v ~/pics/out:/pics.out photoster ./run.py

# The -v are volumes (directories) that are mounted within the docker image as a volume
# /pics.in and /pics.out are paths that the run.py app are looking for.  Those are how the names are 
# mounted within the Docker image.  Use those.
# The other names are directory names external to the Docker image.

# For output to the Seagate mounted drive
# docker run -v ${PWD}/:/workspace/ -v ~/pics/in:/pics.in -v /Volumes/Seagate\ Backup\ Plus\ Drive/pics/:/pics.out photoster ./run.py
